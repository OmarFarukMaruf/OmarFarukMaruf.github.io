                <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                <div class="research-header">

                    <p>I have a great interest in autonomous devices that can run in a dynamic environment, as well as
                        robotics
                        and IoT.
                        That's why I am passionate about Computer Vision, High Performance CPS, and image processing.
                        These
                        interests help
                        me to do research in my final year thesis on Non-permissible Mobile Detection to Enhance
                        Security in
                        Bangladeshi

                        its
                        camera area
                        as well as the individual, and make a security alert.<br><br>

                        I also have a great interest in Defi and Blockchain. From this
                        interest, I obtained a six-month internship as a software intern at SMC Labs BD, work and
                        trained in
                        Blockchain
                        technology. Now I am working as a software engineer at that company and work with the Blockchain
                        solution. Now I
                        want to also work with the blockchain solution and research it, looking for collaborations with
                        professionals.
